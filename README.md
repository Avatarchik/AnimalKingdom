| Plugins | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
|[Unity3D] | [3D Game Engine.][GE]|
| [Zenject] | [Dependency Injection.][DE] |
| [UniRx] | [Reactive Programming.][RP] |
| [C# Promises] | [Asynchronous coding.][AC] |

#### Installation
  - Pull the code.
  - Use Unity 2018.3.4f1 to open it.
  - Check /MainMenu/Game/Always Start from Startup Scene.
  - Press Play.

#### Information:
Delete the /Assets/StreamingAssets/GameState.json & MetaData.json if you want to change the default setting after updating Scriptable Objects.
Meta is not balanced. So you will have to manage.
